Prerequisites:

You'll need to have these libraries with equivalent development versions to build Frogatto:

 boost_iostreams >= 1.35.0
 boost_regex >= 1.35.0
 boost_asio >= 1.35.0
 libsdl >= 1.2.7
 libsdl-image >= 1.2 (with png support)
 libsdl-mixer >= 1.2 (with Vorbis support)
 libsdl-ttf >= 2.0.8
 ccache
 libz

Building:

To build, type 'make'. The Makefile will probably work. :) If it doesn't you may have to tweak it for your platform. The executable 'game' will be created which you can run.
