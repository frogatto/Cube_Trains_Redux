Frogatto & Friends is an old-school 2D platformer game, starring a certain quixotic frog. It's a big adventure with all the classic fun - you fight monsters, collect coins, talk to people, and buy new stuff. Also, Frogatto has a very flexible game engine you can use to make your own creations.

The game's source code license can be found in the LICENSE file in the distribution.
