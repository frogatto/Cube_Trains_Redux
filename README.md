# Cube_Trains_Redux

[Cube Trains](http://ddr0.github.io/cube%20trains/index.html) is track-laying puzzle game
developed by David Roberts(and others). It uses a customized game-engine originally developed for [Frogatto & Friends](https://frogatto.com/).

Due to sharing of some resources and project history, *Cube Trains* was left as a branch within *Frogatto* only to be forgotten with time - until I came along...

This repository is the my effort to extract the last pushed *Cube Trains* branch onto its own stand-alone git repository. I feel this is necessary work as the *Cube Trains* branch was woefully out of step with the master branch of *Frogatto*. For the record, 40 commits ahead but **~5000 commits behind**.

I do not claim ownership over this project. I am merely doing the heavy-lifting necessary to pull the project out of the depths of time.

## Building
Open a terminal window and navigate to into the *Cube Trains* folder.</br>
Execute *make* from the command line (note: use *make -j[number of cores]* to speed compile time)</br>
When completed, you will find the executable **game** in the *Cube Trains* folder.

**Caveat Emptor**</br>
**YMMV**</br>
**ENJOY**</br>
