An old-school 2d platformer game, starring a certain quixotic frog. From the creators of Battle for Wesnoth comes this exciting jump-and-run platformer. Frogatto has gorgeous, high-end pixel art, pumping arcade tunes, and all the gameplay nuance of a classic console title. Run and jump over pits and enemies. Grab enemies with your tongue, swallow them, and then spit them out at other enemies as projectiles! Fight dangerous bosses, and solve vexing puzzles. Collect coins and use them to buy upgrades and new abilities in the store. Talk to characters in game, and work to unravel Big Bad Milgram's plot against the townsfolk! At over 30 levels set in 4 different environments, Frogatto is not a flash in the pan, and has the play-time you'd expect from a real videogame.

Frogatto was made by a group of big-time fans of classic videogames, who are hoping to bring back the magic in a new, original game design with unconventional gameplay mechanics - a fun break from the usual clones. We're a small group of indie developers, hoping this game becomes one of the definitive platform games on iOS - and you can make that happen!
