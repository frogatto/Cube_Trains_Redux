			   level.player, [~Uh.. yeah.~],
			   		[~I mean, you did send thugs in to~,~shake him down.~],
			   		[~That REALLY does look bad.~],
			   me, [~Oh absolutely!~, ~It makes me look beastly!~],
			        [~But consider this...~,~What other option did I have?~],

							  [~Plus a hefty bit of interest.~,
							  ~Penalty Fees.~,
							  ~Late Fees.~,
							  ~Any other fees banks normally charge.~],

				level.player, [~Yup, and I can show you where it all is~,
				               ~in exchange for a small consideration.~],
				me, [~A small consideration eh?~],
				level.player, [~Yes - a quarter of what we get from him.~],
				me, [~*sigh*~, ~I knew you didn't really mean small.~,
				     ~Very well frog, let's do business.~],
