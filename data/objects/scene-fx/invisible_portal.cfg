# This object is not placeable in the editor; it is meant to be spawned by a visible door object (such as a side-door).  The purpose of this is to provide a collision rectangle that will instantly transport the player when the player makes contact.

# The object that spawns this is responsible for setting the target, and (when we have functionality to do so), the collision rectangle.  For now, the collision rectangle automatically defaults to something suitable for the cliff-house doors (3 tiles tall, 1 tile wide).
