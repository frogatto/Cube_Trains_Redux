#we create a 'schedule' for the spike. The spike goes through several states:
# (1) retracted, starting at 0: the spike remains retracted and does nothing, the default state
# (2) stabbing, starting at vars.retracted_ticks: the spike begins extending, and will fully extend within vars.stab_ticks
#               cycles. The spike starts doing damage during this stage.
# (3) extended, starting after vars.stab_ticks: the spike is extended, and remains still.
# (4) retracting, starting after vars.extended_ticks: the spike is retracting, and will fully retract within vars.retract_ticks.
#
# we record this entire schedule within the tmp.command_schedule variable. Then we can just execute this command to
# conveniently set up a full cycle worth of movement for the object.
