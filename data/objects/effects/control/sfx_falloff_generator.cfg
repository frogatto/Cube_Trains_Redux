	#functions for checking if there are other sources playing the same effect so we don't play it twice.  The goal is to play only one instance of a looped sound, but have the volume be that of the closest source - as though every source was playing its own instance.  The rationale is massive optimization by only playing one (rather than, say, 9) sound sources, and also preventing two similar loops out-of-sync from "phasing" and creating audio artifacts.
