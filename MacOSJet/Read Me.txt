Jet's 10.7/XCode 4 setup for building on macs.
Use at your own risk; you're encouraged to use Ben's setup in ./MacOS/ instead.

Ideally, this should be as simple as opening the project file, and clicking build.  All dependencies and prebuilt libs are inside this folder, or are a symlink to a reliable OS-level folder.


Well-maintained general instructions for building on OS X, which are NOT directly relevant to this particular project file, are here:
